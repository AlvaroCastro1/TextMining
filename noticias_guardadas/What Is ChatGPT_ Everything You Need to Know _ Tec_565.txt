ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. The language model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including articles, social media posts, essays, code and emails. ChatGPT is a form of generative AI -- a tool that lets users enter prompts to receive humanlike images, text or videos that are created by AI. ChatGPT is similar to the automated chat services found on customer service websites, as people can ask it questions or request clarification to ChatGPT's replies. The GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer," which refers to how ChatGPT processes requests and formulates responses. ChatGPT is trained with reinforcement learning through human feedback and reward models that rank the best responses. This feedback helps augment ChatGPT with machine learning to improve future responses. OpenAI -- an artificial intelligence research company -- created ChatGPT and launched the tool in November 2022. It was founded by a group of entrepreneurs and researchers including Elon Musk and Sam Altman in 2015. OpenAI is backed by several investors, with Microsoft being the most notable. OpenAI also created Dall-E, an AI text-to-art generator. ChatGPT works through its Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which uses specialized algorithms to find patterns within data sequences. ChatGPT originally used the GPT-3 large language model, a neural network machine learning model and the third generation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer. The transformer pulls from a significant amount of data to formulate a response. This article is part of ChatGPT currently provides access to GPT-3.5 and limited access to the GPT-4o language model. ChatGPT Plus provides access to GPT-4 and GPT-4o. GPT-4 can handle more complex tasks compared to GPT-3.5, such as describing photos, generating captions for images and creating more detailed responses up to 25,000 words. ChatGPT uses deep learning, a subset of machine learning, to produce humanlike text through transformer neural networks. The transformer predicts text -- including the next word, sentence or paragraph -- based on its training data's typical sequence. Training begins with generic data, then moves to more tailored data for a specific task. ChatGPT was trained with online text to learn the human language, and then it used transcripts to learn the basics of conversations. Human trainers provide conversations and rank the responses. These reward models help determine the best answers. To keep training the chatbot, users can upvote or downvote its response by clicking on thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons beside the answer. Users can also provide additional written feedback to improve and fine-tune future dialogue. Users can ask ChatGPT a variety of questions, including simple or more complex questions, such as, "What is the meaning of life?" or "What year did New York become a state?" ChatGPT is proficient with STEM disciplines and can debug or write code. There is no limitation to the types of questions to ask ChatGPT. However, the knowledge cutoff date is late 2023.  ChatGPT is versatile and can be used for more than human conversations. People have used ChatGPT to do the following: Unlike other chatbots, ChatGPT can remember various questions to continue the conversation in a more fluid manner. Businesses and users are still exploring the benefits of ChatGPT as the program continues to evolve. Some benefits include the following: Some limitations of ChatGPT include the following: Learn more about the pros and cons of AI-generated content. While ChatGPT can be helpful for some tasks, there are some ethical concerns that depend on how it is used, including bias, lack of privacy and security, and cheating in education and work. ChatGPT can be used unethically in ways such as cheating, impersonation or spreading misinformation due to its humanlike capabilities. Educators have brought up concerns about students using ChatGPT to cheat, plagiarize and write papers. CNET made the news when it used ChatGPT to create articles that were filled with errors. To help prevent cheating and plagiarizing, OpenAI announced an AI text classifier to distinguish between human- and AI-generated text. However, after six months of availability, OpenAI pulled the tool due to a "low rate of accuracy." There are online tools, such as Copyleaks or Writing.com, to classify how likely it is that text was written by a person versus being AI-generated. OpenAI plans to add a watermark to longer text pieces to help identify AI-generated content. Because ChatGPT can write code, it also presents a problem for cybersecurity. Threat actors can use ChatGPT to help create malware. An update addressed the issue of creating malware by stopping the request, but threat actors might find ways around OpenAI's safety protocol. ChatGPT can also be used to impersonate a person by training it to copy someone's writing and language style. The chatbot could then impersonate a trusted person to collect sensitive information or spread disinformation. One of the biggest ethical concerns with ChatGPT is its bias in training data. If the data the model pulls from has any bias, it is reflected in the model's output. ChatGPT also does not understand language that might be offensive or discriminatory. The data needs to be reviewed to avoid perpetuating bias, but including diverse and representative material can help control bias for accurate results. As technology advances, ChatGPT might automate certain tasks that are typically completed by humans, such as data entry and processing, customer service, and translation support. People are worried that it could replace their jobs, so it's important to consider ChatGPT and AI's effect on workers. Rather than replacing workers, ChatGPT can be used as support for job functions and creating new job opportunities to avoid loss of employment. For example, lawyers can use ChatGPT to create summaries of case notes and draft contracts or agreements. And copywriters can use ChatGPT for article outlines and headline ideas. ChatGPT uses text based on input, so it could potentially reveal sensitive information. The model's output can also track and profile individuals by collecting information from a prompt and associating this information with the user's phone number and email. The information is then stored indefinitely. In March 2023, Italy's data protection authority temporarily banned ChatGPT over concerns that the AI system violated privacy laws by collecting user data for commercial purposes without first obtaining proper consent. The ban was lifted a month later after OpenAI made changes to comply with EU data protection regulations. To access ChatGPT, create an OpenAI account. Go to chat.openai.com and then select "Sign Up" and enter an email address, or use a Google or Microsoft account to log in. After signing up, type a prompt or question in the message box on the ChatGPT homepage. Users can then do the following: Even though ChatGPT can handle numerous users at a time, it reaches maximum capacity occasionally when there is an overload. This usually happens during peak hours, such as early in the morning or in the evening, depending on the time zone. If it is at capacity, try using it at different times or hit refresh on the browser. Another option is to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, which is a subscription, but is typically always available, even during high-demand periods. ChatGPT is available for free through OpenAI's website. Users need to register for a free OpenAI account. There is also an option to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for access to GPT-4, faster responses, no blackout windows and unlimited availability. ChatGPT Plus also gives priority access to new features for a subscription rate of $20 per month. Without a subscription, there are limitations. The most notable limitation of the free version is access to ChatGPT when the program is at capacity. The Plus membership gives unlimited access to avoid capacity blackouts. Because of ChatGPT's popularity, it is often unavailable due to capacity issues. Google announced Bard in response to ChatGPT in February 2023. One year later, Google renamed it Gemini. Google Gemini draws information directly from the internet through a Google search to provide the latest information. Google came under fire after Gemini provided inaccurate results on several occasions, such as rendering America’s founding fathers as Black men. Microsoft has invested $10 billion in OpenAI, making it a primary benefactor of OpenAI. In return, GPT-4 functionality has been integrated into Bing, giving the internet search engine a chat mode for users. Microsoft does this through the use of its Copilot chatbot. Bing searches can also be rendered through Copilot, giving the user a more complete set of search results. There are other text generator alternatives to ChatGPT, including the following: Coding alternatives for ChatGPT include the following: Learn more about various AI content generators. In August 2023, OpenAI announced an enterprise version of ChatGPT. The enterprise version offers the higher-speed GPT-4 model with a longer context window, customization options and data analysis. This model of ChatGPT does not share data outside the organization. In September 2023, OpenAI announced a new update that allows ChatGPT to speak and recognize images. Users can upload pictures of what they have in their refrigerator and ChatGPT will provide ideas for dinner. Users can engage to get step-by-step recipes with ingredients they already have. People can also use ChatGPT to ask questions about photos -- such as landmarks -- and engage in conversation to learn facts and history. Users can also use voice to engage with ChatGPT and speak to it like other voice assistants. People can have conversations to request stories, ask trivia questions or request jokes among other options. The voice update will be available on apps for both iOS and Android. Users will just need to opt-in to use it in their settings. Images will be available on all platforms -- including apps and ChatGPT’s website. In November 2023, OpenAI announced the rollout of GPTs, which let users customize their own version of ChatGPT for a specific use case. For example, a user could create a GPT that only scripts social media posts, checks for bugs in code, or formulates product descriptions. The user can input instructions and knowledge files in the GPT builder to give the custom GPT context. OpenAI also announced the GPT store, which will let users share and monetize their custom bots. In December 2023, OpenAI partnered with Axel Springer to train its AI models on news reporting. ChatGPT users will see summaries of news stories from Bild and Welt, Business Insider and Politico as part of this deal. This agreement gives ChatGPT more current information in its chatbot answers and gives users another way to access news stories. OpenAI also announced an agreement with the Associated Press to use the news reporting archive for chatbot responses. In May 2024, OpenAI released the latest version of its large language model -- GPT-4o -- which it has integrated into ChatGPT. In addition to bringing search results up to date, this LLM is designed to foster more natural interactions. These include voice interactions, allowing users to speak to ChatGPT and receive spoken responses; multimodel input, so ChatGPT can process and generate images as well as words; and an overall improvement in the program’s ability to maintain context over lengthy conversations. OpenAI claims GPT-4o is twice as fast and 50% less expensive than GPT-4 when accessed via their API. GPT-4o is being rolled out gradually to free and paid ChatGPT users, with free users having lower usage limits. It is available in the ChatGPT website/app by selecting the "GPT-4o" model option if you have access to it. ChatGPT’s advanced Voice Mode is now available to small groups of paid ChatGPT Plus users. The new mode offers more natural conversations allowing users to interrupt and ask additional questions. The update lets ChatGPT sense and respond to the user’s emotions with response. The voice is more natural-sounding but is limited to four preset options. On Oct. 31, 2024, OpenAI announced ChatGPT search is available for ChatGPT Plus and Team users. The search feature provides more up-to-date information from the internet such as news, weather, stock prices and sports scores. This new feature allows ChatGPT to compete with other search engines -- such as Google, Bing and Perplexity. ChatGPT automatically searches the internet based on the user's prompt. To access, users select the web search icon -- next to the attach file option -- on the prompt bar within ChatGPT. OpenAI said ChatGPT's free version will roll out this search function within the next few months.

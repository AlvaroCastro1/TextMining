 ChatGPT, OpenAI‚Äôs text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies. That growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory. And its latest partnership with Apple for its upcoming generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, has given the company another significant bump in the AI race. 2024 also saw the release of GPT-4o, OpenAI‚Äôs new flagship omni model for ChatGPT. GPT-4o is now the default free model, complete with voice capabilities. But after demoing GPT-4o, OpenAI paused one of its voices, Sky, after allegations that it was mimicking Scarlett Johansson‚Äôs voice in ‚ÄúHer.‚Äù OpenAI is facing internal drama, including the sizable exit of co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever as the company dissolved its Superalignment team. OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune, for alleged copyright infringement, following a similar suit filed by The New York Times last year. Here‚Äôs a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we‚Äôve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here. In a Reddit AMA, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted that a lack of compute capacity is one major factor preventing the company from shipping products as often as it‚Äôd like, including the vision capabilities for Advanced Voice Mode first teased in May. Altman also indicated that the next major release of DALL-E, OpenAI‚Äôs image generator, has no launch timeline, and that Sora, OpenAI‚Äôs video-generating tool, has also been held back. Altman also admitted to using ChatGPT ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù to answer questions throughout the AMA. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Search, an evolution of the SearchGPT prototype it unveiled this summer. Powered by a fine-tuned version of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o model, ChatGPT Search serves up information and photos from the web along with links to relevant sources, at which point you can ask follow-up questions to refine an ongoing search. üåê Introducing ChatGPT search üåêChatGPT can now search the web in a much better way than before so you get fast, timely answers with links to relevant web sources.https://t.co/7yilNgqH9T pic.twitter.com/z8mJWS8J9c OpenAI has rolled out Advanced Voice Mode to ChatGPT‚Äôs desktop apps for macOS and Windows. For Mac users, that means that both ChatGPT‚Äôs Advanced Voice Mode can coexist with Siri on the same device, leading the way for ChatGPT‚Äôs Apple Intelligence integration. Reuters reports that OpenAI is working with TSMC and Broadcom to build an in-house AI chip, which could arrive as soon as 2026. It appears, at least for now, the company has abandoned plans to establish a network of factories for chip manufacturing and is instead focusing on in-house chip design. OpenAI announced it‚Äôs rolling out a feature that allows users to search through their ChatGPT chat histories on the web. The new feature will let users bring up an old chat to remember something or pick back up a chat right where it was left off. With the release of iOS 18.1, Apple Intelligence features powered by ChatGPT are now available to users. The ChatGPT features include integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience. OpenAI denied reports that it is intending to release an AI model, code-named Orion, by December of this year. An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have plans to release a model code-named Orion this year,‚Äù but that leaves OpenAI substantial wiggle room. OpenAI has begun previewing a dedicated Windows app for ChatGPT. The company says the app is an early version and is currently only available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users with a ‚Äúfull experience‚Äù set to come later this year. OpenAI struck a content deal with Hearst, the newspaper and magazine publisher known for the San Francisco Chronicle, Esquire, Cosmopolitan, ELLE, and others. The partnership will allow OpenAI to surface stories from Hearst publications with citations and direct links. OpenAI introduced a new way to interact with ChatGPT called ‚ÄúCanvas.‚Äù The canvas workspace allows for users to generate writing or code, then highlight sections of the work to have the model edit. Canvas is rolling out in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Teams, with a rollout to come to Enterprise and Edu tier users next week. OpenAI has closed the largest VC round of all time. The startup announced it raised $6.6 billion in a funding round that values OpenAI at $157 billion post-money. Led by previous investor Thrive Capital, the new cash brings OpenAI‚Äôs total raised to $17.9 billion, per Crunchbase. At the first of its 2024 Dev Day events, OpenAI announced a new API tool that will let developers build nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with the choice of using six voices provided by OpenAI. These voices are distinct from those offered for ChatGPT, and developers can‚Äôt use third party voices, in order to prevent copyright issues. OpenAI is planning to raise the price of individual ChatGPT subscriptions from $20 per month to $22 per month by the end of the year, according to a report from The New York Times. The report notes that a steeper increase could come over the next five years; by 2029, OpenAI expects it‚Äôll charge $44 per month for ChatGPT Plus. OpenAI CTO Mira Murati announced that she is leaving the company after more than six years. Hours after the announcement, OpenAI‚Äôs chief research officer, Bob McGrew, and a research VP, Barret Zoph, also left the company. CEO Sam Altman revealed the two latest resignations in a post on X, along with leadership transition plans. After a delay, OpenAI is finally rolling out Advanced Voice Mode to an expanded set of ChatGPT‚Äôs paying customers. AVM is also getting a revamped design ‚Äî the feature is now represented by a blue animated sphere instead of the animated black dots that were presented back in May. OpenAI is highlighting improvements in conversational speed, accents in foreign languages, and five new voices as part of the rollout. A video from YouTube creator ChromaLock showcased how to modify a TI-84 graphing calculator so that it can connect to the internet and access ChatGPT, touting it as the ‚Äúultimate cheating device.‚Äù As demonstrated in the video, it‚Äôs a pretty complicated process for the average high school student to follow ‚Äî but it might stoke more concerns from teachers about the ongoing concerns about ChatGPT and cheating in schools. OpenAI unveiled a preview of OpenAI o1, also known as ‚ÄúStrawberry.‚Äù The collection of models are available in ChatGPT and via OpenAI‚Äôs API: o1-preview and o1 mini. The company claims that o1 can more effectively reason through math and science and fact-check itself by spending more time considering all parts of a command or question. Unlike ChatGPT, o1 can‚Äôt browse the web or analyze files yet, is rate-limited and expensive compared to other models. OpenAI says it plans to bring o1-mini access to all free users of ChatGPT, but hasn‚Äôt set a release date. An artist and hacker found a way to jailbreak ChatGPT to produce instructions for making powerful explosives, a request that the chatbot normally refuses. An explosives expert who reviewed the chatbot‚Äôs output told TechCrunch that the instructions could be used to make a detonatable product and was too sensitive to be released.¬† OpenAI announced it has surpassed 1 million paid users for its versions of ChatGPT intended for businesses, including ChatGPT Team, ChatGPT Enterprise and its educational offering, ChatGPT Edu. The company said that nearly half of OpenAI‚Äôs corporate users are based in the US. Volkswagen is taking its ChatGPT voice assistant experiment to vehicles in the United States. Its ChatGPT-integrated Plus Speech voice assistant is an AI chatbot based on Cerence‚Äôs Chat Pro product and a LLM from OpenAI and will begin rolling out on September 6 with the 2025 Jetta and Jetta GLI models. As part of the new deal, OpenAI will surface stories from Cond√© Nast properties like The New Yorker, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Bon App√©tit and Wired in ChatGPT and SearchGPT. Cond√© Nast CEO Roger Lynch implied that the ‚Äúmulti-year‚Äù deal will involve payment from OpenAI in some form and a Cond√© Nast spokesperson told TechCrunch that OpenAI will have permission to train on Cond√© Nast content. TechCrunch‚Äôs Maxwell Zeff has been playing around with OpenAI‚Äôs Advanced Voice Mode, in what he describes as ‚Äúthe most convincing taste I‚Äôve had of an AI-powered future yet.‚Äù Compared to Siri or Alexa, Advanced Voice Mode stands out with faster response times, unique answers and the ability to answer complex questions. But the feature falls short as an effective replacement for virtual assistants. OpenAI has banned a cluster of ChatGPT accounts linked to an Iranian influence operation that was generating content about the U.S. presidential election. OpenAI identified five website fronts presenting as both progressive and conservative news outlets that used ChatGPT to draft several long-form articles, though it doesn‚Äôt seem that it reached much of an audience. OpenAI has found that GPT-4o, which powers the recently launched alpha of Advanced Voice Mode in ChatGPT, can behave in strange ways. In a new ‚Äúred teaming‚Äù report, OpenAI reveals some of GPT-4o‚Äôs weirder quirks, like mimicking the voice of the person speaking to it or randomly shouting in the middle of a conversation. After a big jump following the release of OpenAI‚Äôs new GPT-4o ‚Äúomni‚Äù model, the mobile version of ChatGPT has now seen its biggest month of revenue yet. The app pulled in $28 million in net revenue from the App Store and Google Play in July, according to data provided by app intelligence firm Appfigures. OpenAI has built a watermarking tool that could potentially catch students who cheat by using ChatGPT ‚Äî but The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is debating whether to actually release it. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is researching tools that can detect writing from ChatGPT, but said it‚Äôs taking a ‚Äúdeliberate approach‚Äù to releasing it. OpenAI is giving users their first access to GPT-4o‚Äôs updated realistic audio responses. The alpha version is now available to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users, and the company says the feature will gradually roll out to all Plus users in the fall of 2024. The release follows controversy surrounding the voice‚Äôs similarity to Scarlett Johansson, leading OpenAI to delay its release. OpenAI is testing SearchGPT, a new AI search experience to compete with Google. SearchGPT aims to elevate search queries with ‚Äútimely answers‚Äù from across the internet, as well as the ability to ask follow-up questions. The temporary prototype is currently only available to a small group of users and its publisher partners, like The Atlantic, for testing and feedback. A new report from The Information, based on undisclosed financial information, claims OpenAI could lose up to $5 billion due to how costly the business is to operate. The report also says the company could spend as much as $7 billion in 2024 to train and operate ChatGPT. OpenAI released its latest small AI model, GPT-4o mini. The company says GPT-4o mini, which is cheaper and faster than OpenAI‚Äôs current AI models, outperforms industry leading small AI models on reasoning tasks involving text and vision. GPT-4o mini will replace GPT-3.5 Turbo as the smallest model OpenAI offers.¬† OpenAI announced a partnership with the Los Alamos National Laboratory to study how AI can be employed by scientists in order to advance research in healthcare and bioscience. This follows other health-related research collaborations at OpenAI, including Moderna and Color Health. OpenAI announced it has trained a model off of GPT-4, dubbed CriticGPT, which aims to find errors in ChatGPT‚Äôs code output so they can make improvements and better help so-called human ‚ÄúAI trainers‚Äù rate the quality and accuracy of ChatGPT responses. OpenAI and TIME announced a multi-year strategic partnership that brings the magazine‚Äôs content, both modern and archival, to ChatGPT. As part of the deal, TIME will also gain access to OpenAI‚Äôs technology in order to develop new audience-based products. OpenAI planned to start rolling out its advanced Voice Mode feature to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users in late June, but it says lingering issues forced it to postpone the launch to July. OpenAI says Advanced Voice Mode might not launch for all ChatGPT Plus customers until the fall, depending on whether it meets certain internal safety and reliability checks. ChatGPT for macOS is now available for all users. With the app, users can quickly call up ChatGPT by using the keyboard combination of Option + Space. The app allows users to upload files and other photos, as well as speak to ChatGPT from their desktop and search through their past conversations. Apple announced at WWDC 2024 that it is bringing ChatGPT to Siri and other first-party apps and capabilities across its operating systems. The ChatGPT integrations, powered by GPT-4o, will arrive on iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year, and will be free without the need to create a ChatGPT or OpenAI account. Features exclusive to paying ChatGPT users will also be available through Apple devices. Scarlett Johansson has been invited to testify about the controversy surrounding OpenAI‚Äôs Sky voice at a hearing for the House Oversight Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation. In a letter, Rep. Nancy Mace said Johansson‚Äôs testimony could ‚Äúprovide a platform‚Äù for concerns around deepfakes. ChatGPT was down twice in one day: one multi-hour outage in the early hours of the morning Tuesday and another outage later in the day that is still ongoing. Anthropic‚Äôs Claude and Perplexity also experienced some issues. The Atlantic and Vox Media have announced licensing and product partnerships with OpenAI. Both agreements allow OpenAI to use the publishers‚Äô current content to generate responses in ChatGPT, which will feature citations to relevant articles. Vox Media says it will use OpenAI‚Äôs technology to build ‚Äúaudience-facing and internal applications,‚Äù while The Atlantic will build a new experimental product called Atlantic Labs. OpenAI announced a new deal with management consulting giant PwC. The company will become OpenAI‚Äôs biggest customer to date, covering 100,000 users, and will become OpenAI‚Äôs first partner for selling its enterprise offerings to other businesses. OpenAI announced in a blog post that it has recently begun training its next flagship model to succeed GPT-4. The news came in an announcement of its new safety and security committee, which is responsible for informing safety and security decisions across OpenAI‚Äôs products. On the The TED AI Show podcast, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner revealed that the board did not know about ChatGPT until its launch in November 2022. Toner also said that Sam Altman gave the board inaccurate information about the safety processes the company had in place and that he didn‚Äôt disclose his involvement in the OpenAI Startup Fund. The launch of GPT-4o has driven the company‚Äôs biggest-ever spike in revenue on mobile, despite the model being freely available on the web. Mobile users are being pushed to upgrade to its $19.99 monthly subscription, ChatGPT Plus, if they want to experiment with OpenAI‚Äôs most recent launch. After demoing its new GPT-4o model last week, OpenAI announced it is pausing one of its voices, Sky, after users found that it sounded similar to Scarlett Johansson in ‚ÄúHer.‚Äù OpenAI explained in a blog post that Sky‚Äôs voice is ‚Äúnot an imitation‚Äù of the actress and that AI voices should not intentionally mimic the voice of a celebrity. The blog post went on to explain how the company chose its voices: Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky. OpenAI announced new updates for easier data analysis within ChatGPT. Users can now upload files directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, interact with tables and charts, and export customized charts for presentations. The company says these improvements will be added to GPT-4o in the coming weeks. OpenAI announced a partnership with Reddit that will give the company access to ‚Äúreal-time, structured and unique content‚Äù from the social network. Content from Reddit will be incorporated into ChatGPT, and the companies will work together to bring new AI-powered features to Reddit users and moderators. OpenAI‚Äôs spring update event saw the reveal of its new omni model, GPT-4o, which has a black hole-like interface, as well as voice and vision capabilities that feel eerily like something out of ‚ÄúHer.‚Äù GPT-4o is set to roll out ‚Äúiteratively‚Äù across its developer and consumer-facing products over the next few weeks. The company announced it‚Äôs building a tool, Media Manager, that will allow creators to better control how their content is being used to train generative AI models ‚Äî and give them an option to opt out. The goal is to have the new tool in place and ready to use by 2025. In a new peek behind the curtain of its AI‚Äôs secret instructions, OpenAI also released a new NSFW policy. Though it‚Äôs intended to start a conversation about how it might allow explicit images and text in its AI products, it raises questions about whether OpenAI ‚Äî or any generative AI vendor ‚Äî can be trusted to handle sensitive content ethically. In a new partnership, OpenAI will get access to developer platform Stack Overflow‚Äôs API and will get feedback from developers to improve the performance of their AI models. In return, OpenAI will include attributions to Stack Overflow in ChatGPT. However, the deal was not favorable to some Stack Overflow users ‚Äî leading to some sabotaging their answer in protest. Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Denver Post, are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The lawsuit alleges that the companies stole millions of copyrighted articles ‚Äúwithout permission and without payment‚Äù to bolster ChatGPT and Copilot. OpenAI has partnered with another news publisher in Europe, London‚Äôs Financial Times, that the company will be paying for content access. ‚ÄúThrough the partnership, ChatGPT users will be able to see select attributed summaries, quotes and rich links to FT journalism in response to relevant queries,‚Äù the FT wrote in a press release. OpenAI is opening a new office in Tokyo and has plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language. The move underscores how OpenAI will likely need to localize its technology to different languages as it expands. According to Reuters, OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman hosted hundreds of executives from Fortune 500 companies across several cities in April, pitching versions of its AI services intended for corporate use. Premium ChatGPT users ‚Äî customers paying for ChatGPT Plus, Team or Enterprise ‚Äî can now use an updated and enhanced version of GPT-4 Turbo. The new model brings with it improvements in writing, math, logical reasoning and coding, OpenAI claims, as well as a more up-to-date knowledge base. You can now use ChatGPT without signing up for an account, but it won‚Äôt be quite the same experience. You won‚Äôt be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have ‚Äúslightly more restrictive content policies,‚Äù according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear: ‚ÄúThe signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,‚Äù a spokesperson said. TechCrunch found that the OpenAI‚Äôs GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that claim to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools. In a court filing opposing OpenAI‚Äôs motion to dismiss The New York Times‚Äô lawsuit alleging copyright infringement, the newspaper asserted that ‚ÄúOpenAI‚Äôs attention-grabbing claim that The Times ‚Äòhacked‚Äô its products is as irrelevant as it is false.‚Äù The New York Times also claimed that some users of ChatGPT used the tool to bypass its paywalls. At a SXSW 2024 panel, Peter Deng, OpenAI‚Äôs VP of consumer product dodged a question on whether artists whose work was used to train generative AI models should be compensated. While OpenAI lets artists ‚Äúopt out‚Äù of and remove their work from the datasets that the company uses to train its image-generating models, some artists have described the tool as onerous. ChatGPT‚Äôs environmental impact appears to be massive. According to a report from The New Yorker, ChatGPT uses an estimated 17,000 times the amount of electricity than the average U.S. household to respond to roughly 200 million requests each day. OpenAI released a new Read Aloud feature for the web version of ChatGPT as well as the iOS and Android apps. The feature allows ChatGPT to read its responses to queries in one of five voice options and can speak 37 languages, according to the company. Read aloud is available on both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models. https://twitter.com/openai/status/1764712432939995549 As part of a new partnership with OpenAI, the Dublin City Council will use GPT-4 to craft personalized itineraries for travelers, including recommendations of unique and cultural destinations, in an effort to support tourism across Europe. New York-based law firm Cuddy Law was criticized by a judge for using ChatGPT to calculate their hourly billing rate. The firm submitted a $113,500 bill to the court, which was then halved by District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who called the figure ‚Äúwell above‚Äù reasonable demands. ChatGPT users found that ChatGPT was giving nonsensical answers for several hours, prompting OpenAI to investigate the issue. Incidents varied from repetitive phrases to confusing and incorrect answers to queries. The issue was resolved by OpenAI the following morning. The dating app giant home to Tinder, Match and OkCupid announced an enterprise agreement with OpenAI in an enthusiastic press release written with the help of ChatGPT. The AI tech will be used to help employees with work-related tasks and come as part of Match‚Äôs $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024. As part of a test, OpenAI began rolling out new ‚Äúmemory‚Äù controls for a small portion of ChatGPT free and paid users, with a broader rollout to follow. The controls let you tell ChatGPT explicitly to remember something, see what it remembers or turn off its memory altogether. Note that deleting a chat from chat history won‚Äôt erase ChatGPT‚Äôs or a custom GPT‚Äôs memories ‚Äî you must delete the memory itself. https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1757469997742666052 Initially limited to a small subset of free and subscription users, Temporary Chat lets you have a dialogue with a blank slate. With Temporary Chat, ChatGPT won‚Äôt be aware of previous conversations or access memories but will follow custom instructions if they‚Äôre enabled. But, OpenAI says it may keep a copy of Temporary Chat conversations for up to 30 days for ‚Äúsafety reasons.‚Äù https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1757470007381082382 Paid users of ChatGPT can now bring GPTs into a conversation by typing ‚Äú@‚Äù and selecting a GPT from the list. The chosen GPT will have an understanding of the full conversation, and different GPTs can be ‚Äútagged in‚Äù for different use cases and needs. https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1752391522081980855 Screenshots provided to Ars Technica found that ChatGPT is potentially leaking unpublished research papers, login credentials and private information from its users. An OpenAI representative told Ars Technica that the company was investigating the report. OpenAI has been told it‚Äôs suspected of violating European Union privacy, following a multi-month investigation of ChatGPT by Italy‚Äôs data protection authority. Details of the draft findings haven‚Äôt been disclosed, but in a response, OpenAI said: ‚ÄúWe want our AI to learn about the world, not about private individuals.‚Äù In an effort to win the trust of parents and policymakers, OpenAI announced it‚Äôs partnering with Common Sense Media to collaborate on AI guidelines and education materials for parents, educators and young adults. The organization works to identify and minimize tech harms to young people and previously flagged ChatGPT as lacking in transparency and privacy.  After a letter from the Congressional Black Caucus questioned the lack of diversity in OpenAI‚Äôs board, the company responded. The response, signed by CEO Sam Altman and Chairman of the Board Bret Taylor, said building a complete and diverse board was one of the company‚Äôs top priorities and that it was working with an executive search firm to assist it in finding talent.¬† In a blog post, OpenAI announced price drops for GPT-3.5‚Äôs API, with input prices dropping to 50% and output by 25%, to $0.0005 per thousand tokens in, and $0.0015 per thousand tokens out. GPT-4 Turbo also got a new preview model for API use, which includes an interesting fix that aims to reduce ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù that users have experienced. https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1750636119321120942 OpenAI has suspended AI startup Delphi, which developed a bot impersonating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) to help bolster his presidential campaign. The ban comes just weeks after OpenAI published a plan to combat election misinformation, which listed ‚Äúchatbots impersonating candidates‚Äù as against its policy. Beginning in February, Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT‚Äôs Enterprise tier, which the university plans to use to build a personalized AI tutor, develop AI avatars, bolster their prompt engineering course and more. It marks OpenAI‚Äôs first partnership with a higher education institution. After receiving the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for her novel The Tokyo Tower of Sympathy, author Rie Kudan admitted that around 5% of the book quoted ChatGPT-generated sentences ‚Äúverbatim.‚Äù Interestingly enough, the novel revolves around a futuristic world with a pervasive presence of AI. In a conversation with Bill Gates on the Unconfuse Me podcast, Sam Altman confirmed an upcoming release of GPT-5 that will be ‚Äúfully multimodal with speech, image, code, and video support.‚Äù Altman said users can expect to see GPT-5 drop sometime in 2024. OpenAI is forming a Collective Alignment team of researchers and engineers to create a system for collecting and ‚Äúencoding‚Äù public input on its models‚Äô behaviors into OpenAI products and services. This comes as a part of OpenAI‚Äôs public program to award grants to fund experiments in setting up a ‚Äúdemocratic process‚Äù for determining the rules AI systems follow. In a blog post, OpenAI announced users will not be allowed to build applications for political campaigning and lobbying until the company works out how effective their tools are for ‚Äúpersonalized persuasion.‚Äù Users will also be banned from creating chatbots that impersonate candidates or government institutions, and from using OpenAI tools to misrepresent the voting process or otherwise discourage voting. The company is also testing out a tool that detects DALL-E generated images and will incorporate access to real-time news, with attribution, in ChatGPT. https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1746986660892741927 In an unannounced update to its usage policy, OpenAI removed language previously prohibiting the use of its products for the purposes of ‚Äúmilitary and warfare.‚Äù In an additional statement, OpenAI confirmed that the language was changed in order to accommodate military customers and projects that do not violate their ban on efforts to use their tools to ‚Äúharm people, develop weapons, for communications surveillance, or to injure others or destroy property.‚Äù Aptly called ChatGPT Team, the new plan provides a dedicated workspace for teams of up to 149 people using ChatGPT as well as admin tools for team management. In addition to gaining access to GPT-4, GPT-4 with Vision and DALL-E3, ChatGPT Team lets teams build and share GPTs for their business needs. After some back and forth over the last few months, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT Store is finally here. The feature lives in a new tab in the ChatGPT web client, and includes a range of GPTs developed both by OpenAI‚Äôs partners and the wider dev community. To access the GPT Store, users must be subscribed to one of OpenAI‚Äôs premium ChatGPT plans ‚Äî ChatGPT Plus, ChatGPT Enterprise or the newly launched ChatGPT Team. https://twitter.com/sama/status/1745135061731803571?s=20 Following a proposed ban on using news publications and books to train AI chatbots in the U.K., OpenAI submitted a plea to the House of Lords communications and digital committee. OpenAI argued that it would be ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and that they believe copyright law ‚Äúdoes not forbid training.‚Äù OpenAI published a public response to The New York Times‚Äôs lawsuit against them and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law, claiming that the case is without merit. In the response, OpenAI reiterates its view that training AI models using publicly available data from the web is fair use. It also makes the case that regurgitation is less likely to occur with training data from a single source and places the onus on users to ‚Äúact responsibly.‚Äù https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1744419710635229424?s=20 After being delayed in December, OpenAI plans to launch its GPT Store sometime in the coming week, according to an email viewed by TechCrunch. OpenAI says developers building GPTs will have to review the company‚Äôs updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines to ensure their GPTs are compliant before they‚Äôre eligible for listing in the GPT Store. OpenAI‚Äôs update notably didn‚Äôt include any information on the expected monetization opportunities for developers listing their apps on the storefront. https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1742970484256366629 In an email, OpenAI detailed an incoming update to its terms, including changing the OpenAI entity providing services to EEA and Swiss residents to OpenAI Ireland Limited. The move appears to be intended to shrink its regulatory risk in the European Union, where the company has been under scrutiny over ChatGPT‚Äôs impact on people‚Äôs privacy. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o. There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.¬† And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they‚Äôll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don‚Äôt know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That‚Äôs a problem when you‚Äôre using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn‚Äôt commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users. It‚Äôs not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it was released March 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can‚Äôt necessarily program an entire app‚Äôs worth of code. That‚Äôs because ChatGPT lacks context awareness ‚Äî in other words, the generated code isn‚Äôt always appropriate for the specific context in which it‚Äôs being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google‚Äôs Gemini and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. OpenAI has¬†said¬†that individuals in ‚Äúcertain jurisdictions‚Äù (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out¬†this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression ‚Äúin accordance with applicable laws‚Äù. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled ‚ÄúOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request‚Äù. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on ‚Äúlegitimate interest‚Äù (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out ‚Äî when it writes: ‚ÄúSee here¬†for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.‚Äù Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI‚Äôs technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT‚Äôs false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they‚Äôre inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users‚Äô conversations to other people on the service. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data. Topics  SpaceX wants to test refueling Starships in space early next year

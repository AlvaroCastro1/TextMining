ChatGPT vs Google Gemini (2024): What Are the Main Differences? Your email has been sent ChatGPT and Google Gemini are AI chatbots designed to generate responses to prompts. When used appropriately, ChatGPT and Google Gemini can support certain business processes in content production, development and more. Take a look at each tool’s features, pros and cons to see which AI chatbot would be best for your business. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI that generates human-like responses based on text input. It has been trained on a huge amount of internet text and enabled by the large language model GPT-4. Like ChatGPT, Google Gemini can answer questions and generate text from prompts. Google Gemini was originally released as Google Bard, a chatbot based on the LaMDA family of large language models. In February 2024, Google introduced Gemini, which was trained on the large language model PaLM, and folded the Bard brand name into Gemini. One major difference is that the free version of ChatGPT lacks up-to-date information, while Gemini can access the internet. The underpinnings of the two AI chatbots are also different: ChatGPT is based on OpenAI’s GPT 4o mini or GPT-4o, depending on free or paid access, and Gemini is based on Google’s Gemini Ultra, Pro or Nano, depending on the language and country. Gemini can interpret images, is interoperable and supports extensions that draw data from Google products such as Google Flights, Hotels, Maps, Drive, Gmail, Docs and YouTube. An upgrade to ChatGPT Plus allows access to many third-party plugins for expanded functionality. Both allow users to upload files for analysis, identification or captioning.

For $20 per month, ChatGPT Plus gives subscribers faster response times and access to new features and GPT-4, GPT-4o or GPT-4o mini (the free version provides access to GPT-4o mini). The GPT-4 API was made generally available in July 2023. The ChatGPT Team plan adds management of team account roles and the ability to share conversations and GPTs among team members. Google Gemini is free, with an unlimited number of questions. Gemini Advanced, which adds more storage, integration into other Google applications and more, costs $19.99 per month. ChatGPT and Google Gemini are useful tools for producing text –– anything from summarizing information to generating a list to creating a poem to writing an essay. Ask either AI system to explain a topic, compare or contrast two or more things or draft an email, and you’ll likely obtain a useful response. ChatGPT and Google Gemini are trained on datasets that include hundreds of billions of parameters, which results in remarkably human-like responses. Since Google Gemini has instant access to the internet, it can produce more current responses than ChatGPT. For instance, if asked “What happened yesterday in Budapest?” Google Gemini can give several bullet points of news events, whereas ChatGPT makes inferences based on the data available as of the most recent training update. However, ChatGPT Plus can browse the internet and return similarly up-to-date answers as Google Gemini. ChatGPT collects information from previous conversations and prior interactions with the user, which means it can use context when engaging in a chat. Gemini can also use context in conversations and can pick up where a user left off. For instance, if you ask: “What do you think about the new employee description I mentioned the other day?” Gemini can respond using the previous cues. However, it sometimes struggles. In this case, “the first Moon mission I asked about” was Chandrayaan-3. Neither of these systems offer as long a context window as another generative AI alternative: Claude. Google Gemini lets you upload an image and ask the system to analyze and tell you details about the image or create a caption for it. As of August 2024, the free version of ChatGPT offers limited image uploads and image creation. Specifically, users of the free tier can create two images with DALL-E 3 per day. Users can also write a text prompt to create an image to illustrate a story, suggest a setting or convey a concept. Upload a document, such as a PDF, and ask ChatGPT questions about the document for an analysis or a summary. ChatGPT and Google Gemini are still in development and may contain errors or biases. Therefore, users should be critical of the information provided by ChatGPT and Google Gemini to ensure its accuracy. In addition, there are privacy concerns that come along with using ChatGPT or Google Gemini, which collect personal information much like search engines do. Your IP address, text and even links to your data, like phone, email and social media, can be gathered. ChatGPT and Google Gemini are free — unless you opt for the paid plans — and both AI chatbots are trained on large natural language models, meaning their responses tend to be similar. Google Gemini has several features that help it stand out. For one, you can get “draft” versions of the response, which offers a variety of responses. Further, Google Gemini is completely up-to-date, with access to online information. ChatGPT, on the other hand, provides impressive responses but lacks access to current internet information. ChatGPT Plus — with GPT-4o, access to DALL-E for images, browsing and advanced data analysis — is widely considered the leading AI chatbot. It’s important to remember that both AI chatbots can be prone to error and bias and collect your personal data — not just the information you input — and can be tools of misuse for bad actors. Learn more about how generative AI works, along with its benefits and dangers. We evaluated these products based on the free versions of ChatGPT and Google Gemini, which are free by default. We tested out how the two AI chatbots would answer the same questions, and we asked ChatGPT and Google Gemini about more current news items to test their limitations.

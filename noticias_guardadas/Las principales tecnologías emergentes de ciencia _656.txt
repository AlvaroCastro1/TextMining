A medida que se adentra en el cambiante mundo de la ciencia de datos, es crucial mantenerse a la vanguardia centr√°ndose en las tecnolog√≠as que prometen dar forma al futuro. Con la aparici√≥n de una gran cantidad de herramientas y metodolog√≠as, identificar cu√°les dominar puede darle una ventaja competitiva. Tanto si eres un cient√≠fico de datos experimentado como si acabas de empezar, comprender y aprovechar estas tecnolog√≠as puede conducir a conocimientos e innovaciones revolucionarias en tu campo.
 
Inteligencia artificial (IA) y Machine Learning (ML) est√°n en el coraz√≥n de los avances de la ciencia de datos. La IA se refiere a las m√°quinas programadas para imitar la inteligencia humana, mientras que el ML es un subconjunto de la IA en el que los algoritmos aprenden de los datos sin ser programados expl√≠citamente. Priorizar estas tecnolog√≠as es esencial, ya que permiten el an√°lisis predictivo, el procesamiento del lenguaje natural y el reconocimiento de im√°genes. Dominarlos requiere una base s√≥lida en estad√≠stica, programaci√≥n y conocimiento del dominio para crear modelos que puedan adaptarse y mejorar con el tiempo.

            The field has moved into the python and pytorch ecosystem. For standard supervised learning the best tools currently are CatBoost and XGBoost while for anything else it's deep learning models. The key benefit is using pretrained models that already understand a domain and can perform tasks with much less data (zero shot and few shot learning ) without the need for big labeled datasets as was done classically.

            There is massive confusion about what is ML, AI, deep learning etc. There is one big decide I see, in reality: if you have tabular data and you want to solve some supervised learning problem (i.e. predict some label from features ) you need a lot of labeled training data. This is the standard world of kaggle competitions and XGBoost and CatBoost are the best supervised methods to use out of the box for tabular data. 

The second space (which is much more active now ) is how to use deep learning models and specifically pretrained foundation models to solve your problems. This is relevant for problems that involve language, images or audio. There you can just ask an LLM (zero shot ) or fine-tune an LLM with tens or hundreds of examples only

            Deep learning is the best thing you'd be mastering in the Artificial Intelligence Arena. By mastering Deep learning you'll have mastered a bit of everything else in the fields of Machine Learning and Big Data concepts.
Until corporations acquire General Purpose AI, research is going to continue in A.I and deep learning is likely to be at the fore front of this research. 
Someone in the field of deep learning will be more likely to adapt when that time comes.

On the other hand, the field is evolving fast. Time may come when deep learning architectures are totally different from what we know today - something like graph networks instead of neural networks. 
Even then, having mastered deep learning will come in handy.

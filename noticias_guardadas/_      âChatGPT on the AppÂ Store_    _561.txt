He has pretty severe dyslexia. When he was in grade school they didnât screen for dyslexia as well as they do now and so he didnât get diagnosed until after high school.After showing him how to download the app and getting him started I walked out of the room. When I came back he had tears streaming down his face and the level of emotion he was experiencing made it impossible for him to talk. The scene reminded me of a video I had seen of a kid in a third world country given a pair of glasses and being able to see clearly for the first time. When he calmed down enough to get words out he said that this technology is going to change his whole life. I guess I never really understood how limiting his dyslexia is for him day in day out. For my husband college was out of reach even though he tests with an IQ well above average. He struggles daily with writing emails and pricing quotes at work, or even just looking up information. Heâs started using ChatGPT for that, which is life changing. But whatâs really life altering is the creative outlet he now has for getting his words on the page. Heâs using ChatGPT to help write an autobiographical story about his life, something he felt was impossible before. I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app. In the beginning, this application really seemed to be pretty stunning. But unfortunately, within the recent months, it appears to be going downhill in terms of performance. I constantly find myself using up my message caps with the GPT-4 model, just trying to get a simple process done. Whether it be generating a specific image or trying to get basic research on a subject online, the model seems to be taking shortcuts and not adhering to the specific custom instructions that you give it. And it becomes very frustrating because it gives these long, dragged-out responses that don't really correlate with what you're asking. And it tends to be very vague in finding exactly what you want. I'm no expert in AI, and I can't imagine how complex the software is to try and navigate. But at the end of the day, as someone who has a PLUS subscription, if I'm paying money for this premium service, I would like to be getting it. I shouldn't be running into my message cap just from trying to complete one task. That doesn't really seem fair. And again, the performance seems to be getting worse as time goes on. So I'm not sure what the problem is. But I kindly ask for you to please fix the model. Because at the end of the day, this was meant to be a tool to make certain tasks easier to complete. But now, unfortunately, it has become very difficult to get things done. And it's becoming a bit of a negative experience, rather than a fun one like it was when it first released.

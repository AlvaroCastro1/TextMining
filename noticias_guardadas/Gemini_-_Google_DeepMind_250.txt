Latest posts Latest research posts Latest technology posts Latest posts Technologies Updated production-ready Gemini models, reduced 1.5 Pro pricing, increased rate limits, and more Technologies Gemini breaks new ground: a faster model, longer context and AI agents Technologies Our next-generation model: Gemini 1.5 Technologies The next chapter of our Gemini era The most general and capable AI models we've ever built. Each Gemini model is built for its own set of use cases, making a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to on-device. Ultra Our largest model for highly complex tasks. Pro Our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks. Flash Our lightweight models in two variants, optimized for speed and efficiency. Nano Our most efficient model for on-device tasks. Project Astra explores the future of AI assistants. Building on our Gemini models, we’ve developed AI agents that can quickly process multimodal information, reason about the context you’re in, and respond to questions at a conversational pace, making interactions feel much more natural.  The demo shows two continuous takes: one with the prototype running on a Google Pixel phone and another on a prototype glasses device. Gemini models are built from the ground up for multimodality, seamlessly combining and understanding text, code, images, audio, and video. Following content is a visual/ descriptive representation of the functionality of Gemini:

              I see the time signature is 6/8. This means there are 6 eighth notes in each measure.
             
              The dynamic marking is piano, which means to play softly. Andante grazioso means to play at a graceful walking pace.
             1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash both have a default context window of up to one million tokens — the longest context window of any large scale foundation model. They achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, unlocking the ability to process long documents, thousands of lines of code, hours of audio, video, and more. For 1.5 Pro, developers and enterprise customers can also sign up to try a two-million-token context window. Research Our research team is continually exploring new ideas at the frontier of AI, building innovative products that show consistent progress on a range of benchmarks.
